The sum of 10 no is : 55
The Average is : 5.500000

#include <stdio.h> 
void main() 
{ 
int i,n,sum=0; 
float avg; 
printf("Input the 10 numbers : \n"); 
for (i=1;i<=10;i++) 
{
printf("Number-%d :",i); 
scanf("%d",&n); sum +=n; 
} 
avg=sum/10.0; printf("The sum of 10 no is : %d\nThe Average is : %f\n",sum,avg); 
}
